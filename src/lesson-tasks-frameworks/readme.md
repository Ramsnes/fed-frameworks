## Descriptions

- **JSX**
  JSX, which stands for JavaScript XML, is the syntax we use to write HTML-like code in React

- **Component**
  A component is essentially a function that returns JSX

- **Props**
  Props are values we pass into our components using key/value pairs, similar to HTML attributes. These values will then be available inside the component.
  E.g: <MyComponent myKey="My value" />

- **Events**
  Referred to as "handle".E.g onClick={}

- **State**
  State will persist between app updates, so we will never lose these values

  "If we pass a state into a component and we update that state, then the component will automatically be updated with that state value."
