## Descriptions

- **JSX**
  JSX, which stands for JavaScript XML, is the syntax we use to write HTML-like code in React

- **Component**
  Components are reusable building blocks in React that represent UI elements

- **Props**
  Props can be seen as utilizing the argument and implementing it in JSX

- **Events**
  Referred to as "handle".
  E.g <buttononClick={}>Click me</button>

- **State**
  State will persist between app updates, so we will never lose these values

  "If we pass a state into a component and we update that state, then the component will automatically be updated with that state value."
